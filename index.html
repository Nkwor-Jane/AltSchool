        <h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
        <p>I firmly believe in striving for excellence to achieve one’s goals, 
            and this principle is especially true for my journey to becoming a 
            software engineer. While I’ve built a foundation in programming through 
            self-learning and mentorship, I recognize the importance of taking 
            deliberate steps to align my actions with my aspirations. Joining 
            ALTSchool provides the structured learning and hands-on 
            experience I need to achieve my goal of becoming a proficient software engineer.
